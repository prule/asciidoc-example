=== Including code snippets

This is awesome - we can insert snippets of code from files. There are several ways to do this, but here I'm showing how to do it by using tags in the source code.

You can tag the source code like this:
```
    // tag::tag1[]
<awesome code goes here>
    // end::tag1[]
```

And then you can reference the tag in an include:

```
[source,kotlin,indent=0]
----
\include::../../test/kotlin/org/example/LibraryTest.kt[tags=tag1]
----
```

And you'll get this:

// works with intellij and gradle with
//         baseDirFollowsSourceDir()
[source,kotlin,indent=0]
----
include::../../test/kotlin/org/example/LibraryTest.kt[tags=tag1]
----

Or, using the source attribute (specified in gradle and in intellij plugin settings):

This
```
[source,kotlin,indent=0]
----
\include::{source}/org/example/LibraryTest.kt[tags=tag1]
----
```

Will produce:

[source,kotlin,indent=0]
----
include::{source}/org/example/LibraryTest.kt[tags=tag1]
----

The intellij plugin will show you the result in a preview pane, and you can click on the tag to jump to it. If the link doesn't resolve, you'll see the error highlighted in the editor.
